com.paypal.android.p2pmobile,"They did something to mess it up. I suspect they're trying to push PayPal users into new credit cards or debit systems to generate more revenue for PayPal, but actions that used to be simple and straightforward are now unnecessarily complicated. For example transferring my PayPal balance to my bank account used to be very straightforward, but now the setting is buried. I clicked on the wrong thing multiple times before I finally scrolled way down and found what I was looking for. When the app works, it's great. But if there's issues, it's nearly impossible to get a hold of an actual person or to get any answers as far as what the issue actually is. Its very nice on a perfect day but incredibly aggravating if even the smallest thing goes wrong (such as, if you have direct deposit set up and you get paid on the same day and the same time for months but then it doesn't show up in your account one day and the money has already been sent, but no one can help find the $$). I gave the app 2 stars because it's literally impossible to pay your Paypal Credit bills on the app. Every time I try linking my bank account, it says it was successful and that I can close the window but it doesn't save my linked bank to my Paypal account. I've probably tried this over 10 times already and it's frustrating. I have to keep calling to make payments now. Don't add a screen that exits out of Paypal Credit and removes all of the progress made to link your bank account. My most secured way of paying, however, won't stay consistent with preferred way to pay, keeps using wrong card unless I remove all other cards. Very selectively will allow choice, but doesn't do so for all purchases. Gonna cost me greatly, thanks to a recent blunder (small payment, but due to an issue I'm unable to talk about, major cost for this year). I don't have time to fight with any CS.

Upon attempting to log in to the IndieApp, I noticed that the app currently only offers the option to open a new account, with no visible option for existing users to log in.

Hello recently on my other device M01 after the upgrade option came... app is not able to open... also it shows not supported... but previous version of that was working fine... so developer please make the upgrade optional for this kind of device as customer are not going to change phone for the update... make it working like previous. Not allowing the app to even run because developer options is enabled is pure stupidity! Most banking apps show a warning to the user and allow to proceed, but no, IndusInd has to be different and non-user friendly. Some of us need developer options enabled on our phones and we know what we are doing with it. EDIT: Unable to use the app at all and no response or resolution from the development team since a week! This is the level of customer service one can expect from IndusInd We're in 23', & this thing looks & functions like it's stuck in the Stone Age. Seriously, we need some major improvements on the UI. And come on, give us more payment options! We're not just about net banking. We want to pay with UPI, and even simple debit cards.

It really is a comprehensive and solid money management tool. This financial management app is a game changer! It's super easy to use and has everything I need to take control of my finances. The integration with my bank makes it super convenient to track my transactions, and the personalized recommendations help me make smarter financial choices. Plus, the data security features give me peace of mind. The user interface is intuitive, and the educational resources are very helpful for understanding complex financial concepts. Overall, this app has changed my financial health! This app is a massive scam and poses a serious threat to your privacy. While it might seem convenient for quick access to funds, it secretly accesses sensitive personal data like your contacts and photos.

My issue is, I'm at level 274, completed challenges, finished my bank, and now I'm waiting for the next bank to be developed. I'll give it another day, but after that the game will be deleted. Ads are not credited correctly. Very often, I have to watch several ads to get 1 ads worth of the promised credit. I have storage space. I have good wifi. So the error is not on my end. I don't mind watching the ads but please don't make me repeat the experience multiple times. One credit per one ad is fair. I've encountered this many times. Please fix. Game has no depth. Wait for cash. Buy a tiny upgrade. Wait forever. In the meantime, spend all your money on a matching game no one asked for. Or have the game play it for you. But it's a requirement for progress. Events scale with level so you can't reach the end goal. To make any progress, you have to watch ads for boost, ads for cash, ads for managers, ad for XP. I played this game for premium currency and it paid less than 1 per ad. Interesting concept and kind of fun but let's be honest there's no end of the game there's no winning so it's endless but even that is ok it's a good time waster. But way, way, way too many ads to progress. Not enough entertainment to offset 200 ads a day just to accomplish some progress. Fun to play at first but becomes a grind very fast.

com.transferwise.android,"I have been using Wise for several months now and I am very pleased with how intuitive and responsive it is. I look up exchange rates quickly and easily and I have been able to pay for things in local currency with no issue at all. The security is very high, as I learned, since some of my US paperwork was not fully up to date and I had to correct things to become approved! That has also given me confidence in the platform. Didn't read anything about this app before installing it and was scared if the money from Europe in Euro would get to American bank account. Tried sending several hundred first, it took less than three days before appearing in American bank account. Second transfer I did was done in less than 6 hours without issue! The only issue - taking pictures and providing documents for confirming idenity took several tries. But I definitely recommend this app and will use it for international transfers. Well now this application became a nightmare..after attempting to transfer a large amount. They requested verification. I sent the ID with only one of my last names and got rejected. That I understand. After uploading my passport and was accepted, the software keeps rejectingy transfer. Followed all the customer service instructions , resend etc and the app keeps asking for a good ID. Cancelling my account. Nightmare software loop... Well, I have to say the app is better. Not sure why... The good: transactions happen super fast! Needs improvement: for 2+ yrs of a monthly payment (same amount, same recipient) every single month, without exception, the steps/procedures have had *some* variation over the previous month. I don't know if this is due to the company constantly tweaking the app with the intention of improving it, but it is frustrating and annoying. No messages announcing changes, no error messages.

There is no official fee, yet selling and buying is at a different price. Overall, Wise is slightly cheaper (fraction of a percent) with their fees included. I prefer their transparency with fees clearly stated and not hidden behind different sell and buy prices. Back up to 4 stars for revolut. Would be 5 stars but the inability to talk to a human over the phone is infuriating when there are issues. Which so far, have been few. I've used revolut in the USA, France, Mexico, Australia and the UK. It has been absolutely seamless moving between and transferring money between all of my accounts. This is what banking should be. I have tried multiple times to verify my identity and it locks up on the document choice screen. I have made sure that the back and front of my Driver's License is clear and that there is proper light. I have tried chatting with the AI support but it's useless, I just keep getting emails stating I need to verify. I give up, I have never had this much of an issue verifying my identity. Absolutely the worst bank I have ever used, constantly declining transactions and freezing your card with reputable merchants, app doesn't work half the time, cannot verify identity if you get locked out, app is buggy and half the features do not work, customer support is no help half the time.

co.uk.getmondo,"As a bank, they're fine. No major issues in 5 years. They really need to do more UX testing on the app though. I'm tech-proficient and I find myself clicking around on various tabs trying to find/do basic things. It's not intuitive at all. I've been using it for years and I still couldn't tell you where half the stuff is if you asked me. Great app and easy to use although some features are unorganised and a bit messy which means when you want to pay someone it will take a while to find to them. More worryingly I had my account emptied out through numerous similar purchases in the USA. How this wasn't flagged as suspicious is beyond me. I noticed it the day after but Monzo took two weeks (!) to refund the ¬£7k. I now only keep very small amounts in this account and use Starling instead. Btw I rarely use my card.... The app doesn't work, I can't progress to opening an account. I get sent a magic link to my email, then get a page saying ""sorry about this... Something's gone wrong"" it's been like that for a month I spoke to customer service who were supposed to arrange a call back to fix things and never heard anything. I tried calling again and went down a phoneline rabbit hole that doesn't accept non customer calls. Do not use the app for bank transfers! You can not download a proof of payment, nor will Monzo provide you one! You can't even grab a screenshot with all the necessary details as that view doesn't exist! With the 'simplified' look it is also too easy to miss adding the reference field. I used to be a fan of Monzo, but that was when I hardly used it for anything.

com.finimize.oban,"Content is amazing. However, poor UI/UX design. Please work on enabling us to save articles and audio files for later. The app needs a good menu for users to choose which kinds of media to consume. Articles? Audios? When from? Analyst Insights or other content? Sometimes I dont just want to read today's news! I signed up to finimize few years back and loved it the email briefs were awesome. I was very excited for the launch of the initial iPhone app and subsequently the Android version but now whenever I try to read the brief in app it asks me to subscribe. All the other options always ask me to subscribe the only 'unlocked packs' are the basics of investing and creating a portfolio. The application may as well be subscriber only since all the content is locked. The app works well just misleading. I'm giving it a 2-star only because I've been a subscriber for their email services for over two years now which is great - highly recommended! As to the app: -wherever you click it leads to the subscribe here section -although the subscription is worth $59.99 (100 BGN in local currency), in the app it costs 134.99 BGN -only an annual subscription -I can't find the ""Unlocked packs"" section with the free to read articles and if I click once without reading it, then I can't access it again The app has great content. However, please stop trying to deduct money from my card. I tried to subscribe to the premium but didn't go through because of limit placed on my card by my bank. I have since cancelled the subscription but everyday you keep trying to deduct the money. If you keep trying that from now till next 5 years you would still be getting the same response. So kindly stop since I am not active on any subscription at the moment. Please stop, it's rather frustrating.",genuine
com.moneylion,"This is a great app that allows access to quick cash when you need it. For that I thank you.

I would like a secondary app that is just banking focused. I love all of the features, but sometimes I need to get in quickly without weaving through everything, and I grow frustrated with the extra steps needed to to get to my most recent transactions. it only would save seconds but seconds add up I use this app for cash advances to help with inflation expenses. I appreciate, that these funds are avaliable immediately. However at times my cash advance balances show a certain amount, then I look again and that amount is reduced to $0.00. It almost seems best to take the whole amount at one time. But I don't like to do that, I like it to be there for & incase I need it, not get it all when I don't. MoneyLion is a helpful app with great features like cash advances, credit-building loans, and investing tools. It‚Äôs user-friendly and can be a real lifesaver when you need quick cash.

Biggest complaint would be that even though your Amazon account is linked, you can't track it via the app. It only links you to the order, and not the tracking itself. Once it's delivered, you then have to go archive the order. Terrible app when merchant is unreliable. My order showed as pending for three weeks so I contacted the merchant and asked them to cancel. Instead, they then finally processed the order. When I tried to enter a problem with the order on Shop it wouldn't accept the complaint because the order wasn't 30 days old. This platform just assumes everything will be good with orders and customer service is lacking and terrible when there is a problem. I won't use it again for these reasons. This app keeps getting worse and worse. I moved away from using a spreadsheet back in 2022 because It was AMAZING to use. Every subsequent update got worse, drastic UI changes, package updates moved to a sub page, package updates HOURS late, removal of dark mode, can't swipe left to archive packages anymore, bottom bar is a tiny floating window that causes miss-presses. It's basically the Shopify app. If there was an award for worst updates over a 3 year period this would get 1st place.",genuine
com.tdbank,"This app is beautiful. I have had no problems with it. I like the security settings. You can set up a security settings when you try to get into your banking account with not only your fingerprint. But you can also set up so where they send you a code every time you sign in. I love everything about this app. Also there's a setting on the app in the menu you can call them. And you were put in the front of the line for waiting. I recommend banking with TD Bank. They make you feel like family. EDIT: App works great, mobile deposit is greatly improved since the early days. Biometric login also works well. Easy to view accounts, transfer funds, and to send money via Zelle. --- Mobile deposit is garbage. When you take a picture of a check it vibrates the phone for confirmation... ensuring that the image blurs. It NEVER recognizes computer printed payroll checks. Which is fine I guess since no one ever needs to deposit those üòí I can't believe they updated the login screen, breaking password autofill in the process, and STILL have not fixed it. This is a security issue. Autofill is more secure than clipboard where any app can access it, and breaking that is NOT ok, besides for the extra inconvenience of not having the popup right there. Please fix this. Edit: still a problem in 2025. set your autofill hints in your view or your compose components. Few lines for massive security and QoL improvement For several days, I mostly can't get the app to work right. It takes forever to open, staying on the green screen, and when it finally does, won't allow biometrics or username and password.

My only suggestion would be to keep the app simple and not overload it with too many features, which usually results in a less than ideal experience. In its current version, the app is simply a pleasure to use. One of the best app to get crisp and interesting financial news. However the bugs are never fixed :/.

Now facing a new issue and I've already emailed the support team twice and there has been no response or support. I'm trying to invest, still poor support from team. Update 3: Team reached out to me and clarified why I'm not able to open an account. Thanks for the info and your commitment to be best. It is totally fraud. Do not get trapped in it. First thing is for video kyc they want to restart the device (which seems like weird behaviour). Second thing is they haven't refunded my FD amount and asking for my bank statement( why they need my bank statement, they can share transaction id for the refund if they have refunded instead they are asking my whole bank statement which is a privacy concern). No banks ask anything like this. They can refund based on the ""journey id"" of the applicant. Like every other I believed that it's a great app.but the real face comes when the deposit amount got matured and not refunded to the account, following up multiple times with customer care,the issue is not resolved even after 5 days sating that there is a issue from bank side.Neither the support team is responding to the ticket nor to the email. Think the traditional way of holding deposit is a way less effortless than comming here and blocked funds and waiting",genuine
com.usbank.mobilebanking,"This app has been very reliable for me, and has all the features I typically use, and then some! 10/10 good stuff Edit: No complaints since, but I have to say the speed and reliability with which this app operates definitely sets the bar for other personal banking software. The UI is clean and well organized, which makes it super easy to use. I must applaud both the software engineers and designers for excellent execution! Solid app. Be careful about retaking pictures of your check cuase it can add both pictures and withdraw more than you earned leading to debt. Outside of this, it makes managing your money easy, straight to the point and they actively try to do better with their app. Which is an amazing thing to have in a bank. Reliable and warns you when the app is going under maintenance. Terrible app. Clunky, irrelevant adds that pop up every time you enter. I press the ""X"" to close, and if it's not perfect, it follows a hyperlink to the service. The redesign put critical functions in strange places. They look like search terms under the search bar. Exceedingly poor design. Reasonable functionality. Not a good business app. Each time I access this app is for my business accounts.

com.freecash.app2,"It's really difficult to make any money in this app. A lot of the games don't match what I would like to play. Updated this to 4 stars. The more I leveled up, the more games and options I had. I wish it were this way when you first download it otherwise it's misleading to new users. I took away a star because one of the games didn't track and I didn't receive my payout for that and I put in a ticket with screenshots and still didn't receive. I originally gave this a 1 star rating which now has changed. I want to thank the team for reaching out to me and fixing the issue. Only thing I would change is the high expectations on certain games that seem very impossible to reach in the certain amount of time they want you to. However, love the pay out and I love the little extras they put in there as well. I initially liked this app, but recently it has been absolutely infuriating. First off, the app likes to sneakily hide time limits on offers for games unless you scroll ALL the way down and open a little tab to see it. Second of all, unless you directly download the app the first time you open it, you won't be awarded for your progress for some reason. Third of all, when you send a support ticket in app, it gets quietly dealt with with NO notification or email. Would add more but can't. It was a hard decision between 2 and 3 stars. But I just can't justify 3 stars for now. You can actually earn money using this app (100-300 is possible). Now, the main problems for me are that some of the rewards/offers don't work automatically, so you need to open a support ticket that can be declined after 10+ days with a generic explanation that it didn't pass checks or something very generic. So, good luck build a streak. They gave me VIP after a few days and then took it back for no reason",genuine

Update: I've been using Remitly for over 10 years and it just keep getting better. Much faster now. I made the mistake a few years ago of going to another well known money transfer service. It was a nightmare! Even my bank told me to avoid them. Came back to Remitly and never looked back. A truly simple, affordable, and reliable money transfer app. I was very skeptical about using the app but after making several transfers ai have grown to appreciate the simplicity of using the app and especially the security and reliability of making international transfers. Big banks charge way too much to and take too long. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. Great rates and a great way to save money when travelling. Just one suggestion...when sending to certain countries you need to choose the agent that you're sending to, but it doesn't give address details or a map view. It is not uncommon for stores to have different names on the app to their Google maps name. More details of the pickup agent would be highly appreciated The good news is they seem to be reliable, not the cheapest, but they seem real and it works. The bad news is they don't seem set up for your ID having an address different than the billing address on your debit card. That triggered a security concern that was unresolvable because what they wanted was then for me to send in copies of my banking statements which is NOT going to happen. I trust them to a point but I do not trust them with that level of information, it's unnecessary. So I deleted.",genuine

I don't have time to constantly correct this thing. It's clearly made for a weird class of people I've never been a part of.

Ok app. Really nickels and dimes you for everything. Go premium cost $ (and really not useful without it). Want to lower bills like the ads, that's more $ (not really sure if it actually works). In the end, I just went back to my old budgeting software. This would have ended up costing me more money than without it. I installed and subscribed to the app for one subscription I wanted it to cancel for me but it couldn't help me. It told me the steps to take but I already knew the steps (going in person or writing a certified letter).

I'm totally addicted going on 37 days straight. Looking forward to the next levels. Thank you money masters for the dedication in providing an easy to understand format, bite size learning at your own pace.. So far it's been a great informative app. However, the email issue needs to be rectified. I initially had issues getting in using the email. Also, when I got to level 2 to start module 1 within that section it doesn't carry me to start. Overall the app seems great. I would like to rate it a 5 but due to those issues it isn't so great. I stop playing the game because after a while, it does not let me log back in and it's frustrating. It recognises my email but still does not allow me to login. I would really like to get pass this hurdle as the game is very informative. This issue needs rectifying.",genuine
com.infonow.bofa,"This app with Bank of America is great. Just one suggestion, it would be great if you guys could fix my relationship with Zelle since for no reason they have banned me from using their services through my Account with you, and it would be great if you can add an auto time delay on the card lock, to auto lock after a specific alloted time after unlocking. The app is highly reliable, and I like it a lot, but I'd like it even more if it included: 1. The ability to make external ACH transfers to other banks, and 2. The ability to divest Merrill Lynch holdings and transfer the cash elsewhere. Both of these functions are already available thru the full BofA web site, but that typically takes a real computer to do. The app is full of bugs. It gets on verification loops asking for activation/text verification/ password input at least two or three times. Options to manage credit cards are difficult to find and they are located in different parts of the app instead of having everything related to the card in one place. Options like changing the due date should be on the app instead of having to reach out to customer service for it. You should copy what Chase do with their app and Amex online customer service. This app is very hard to navigate. it feels like you have to jump through so many non-essential hoops just to make a payment. You are not able to immediately see that your payment has posted to your account. The only way I knew it went through is that when I tried to make another payment (because I didn't think it had gone through) it asked me if I wanted to make another payment today. There is just so much unnecessary information as they try to push more product on you.",genuine

IndusMobile was decent enough and not very outdated. An in-place update could've worked. Also, the developers could've included some sort of disclaimer in the IndusMobile app itself that it's reaching the end of its life. 2. This isn't a very big problem, but the app feels cumbersome just like the previous one. 3. Bug Report: In the PDF account statements, the bank balance falsely shows the two last digits for paise as zeroes. App is ok but pls disable exit when developers option is enabled. Some people like use it to reduce animations, force dark mode on apps that doesn't have a built in dark mode, restrict background apps to make devices run fast and lean.

co.feeld,"Lots of good progress on the app! Still has some quirks, but it's so much more usable now. In terms of users, it's certainly sexually forward. Slightly more difficult to find a relationship. The app is quite versatile though so it's cool that you can try to find a lot of different kinds of people/relationships. Best poly dating app I've tried so far. Lets you scroll back and forth between people without having to make an immediate decision. The free version doesn't let you ""see"" who likes you, but it gives you their username (which is more than most dating apps) so it's pretty easy to figure out who it is. My only complaint is that it only shows you distance and not what city people are in. 10 miles from me could be a suburb or could be Canada. I haven't had any glitches so far. Maybe I've been lucky. good people on the app but the ux is terrible and buggy especially given how expensive it is for the paid plan. i had location services off while editing my profile and was harassed by a recurring pop up no matter how many times I dismissed it. the keyboard covers the text box after a couple lines. you can't limit or easily filter out people from seeing/liking you. traveling at all means you end up with tons of irrelevant likes. Overall experience is pretty good, but the feed keeps refreshing while I'm browsing. üò° Annoying AF. Otherwise, I love that it's lifestyle friendly. Definitely the best dating app I've ever used.

It forces you to make a full monthly instalment payment, when the monthly payment is already made for the month. Also no option to pay just arrears. The app is so buggy, painful to use. I think this is a flaw of the new design Informative to know when you have to pay. Useless for paying... When I hit pay with any of the methods, it simply takes me to the website of the method, not even the app (revolut, transferwise).

As an app, it's a really great financial tool and doesn't really have any major bugs at all in my experience. Overall, very satisfied with using the app. I have three chase credit cards. However, the only one I use all the time is my amazon prime. For when I consider an obvious reason. Cash back with amazon. Can't beat it. I've had very little problems with this bank.

com.rbi.mani,"Good initiative. But Need some improvements. 1) The sound dictation is really high...

So this needs to be fixed. 2) Its getting confused bw 10 & 100, 20 & 200 and 50 & 500. 3) And Think it should have a feature to deduct multiple notes at once... maybe upto 5-10 notes. It should tell the user what are all the denominations in that stack, total number of notes, summation, etc., It works well with all other notes except old ‚Çπ10 note, for some reason it says ‚Çπ5 note. I tested it with multiple ‚Çπ10 notes the result was the same. I even tried zooming in and out the distance no changes in result. Also the notes should be layed out straight. There shouldn't be any other notes below the note being identified. It hard to mark a score for reliability of the app. But if you can't trust anyone around you, then the app could be life saver. What seems to be a great initiative, seems almost inpractical for regular daily usage for the blinds. As it seems to be a lot of effort for the person using it just to get the denomination from certain angles only. The app gives incorrect denominations & results when the notes are curved or placed at certain irregular angles. From a blind person perspective this is not a thing they would rely on. Instead I would recommend the BA's to involve people from the disabled community and develop acc. Many issues with the app. Voice is too high and above all it does not serve the purpose.

com.sbi.lotusintouch,"I have been using this YONO SBI Application since 2024 and found it quite safe, secure, smooth & user friendly, specially the dynamic keypad for each time login through MPIN! However the frequent bank server issue needs to be improved. Overall my banking experience within this single efficient app is seamless & convenient. Now I can also suggest to anyone that ""You Only Need One"" for both Banking & Lifestyle! ü§ë YONO SBI is an excellent banking app that makes transactions simple and convenient.with this single app,you can perform NEFT,IMPS and quick transfer effortlessly . The user interface is smooth and the app offers a wide range of banking services, including bill payment, accoun management, and even shopping options. One of the best features is its ease of use fund transfer are fast and secure, making it a great choice for SBI customers. However, occasional server issues can sometimes caus is also. Why does your app display a popup insisting on upgrading to a newer Android version? What exactly is wrong with Android 11 or earlier? Other apps provide services just fine on these versions. If security is genuinely a concern, shouldn‚Äôt you develop a more robust application? If customer service truly matters to you, how can you justify excluding devices with Android 8 and above? Are you seriously suggesting your app can‚Äôt handle backward compatibility? This is unacceptable. Your app should work Hi I have hard time trying to make it work. After waiting for several mins, it finally says technical error. Some times it says number not in the system. When I tried yono lite, it didn't complain and it worked. Lite version don't have reservations, shopping, airline tickets features. This app really sucks. It's useless. I can't believe that SBI deploying such a lousy mobile app. Please look into it and fix the issue. Your reputation is on the line.",genuine
com.varomoney.bank,"Recently, within the last month, it takes multiple tries to open my banking app. If I have another app open, it can take up to 6 tries before it prompts me for my fingerprint. It will just stay on the varo purple screen. Sometimes, I have to close all applications before the app will let me sign in. It's getting frustrating. And yes, the app is up to date. I've had the account for several years and haven't had any issues. I like using Varo Advance and the high apy. Overall, I like the interface. The transactions tracking could be more user friendly. I'm sad that Zelle isn't an option anymore. I was initially impressed with the option to recommend features, but that has gone away, though many features were implemented. The only thing I need is an option to set savings goals and divide by some sort of bucket. I use another bank for that feature. Love this bank but the app doesn't work well anymore outside of banking. For example: if I clicked on Varo Advance (or whatever it's called) it will get stuck on the loading screen and never load. If I click on help, and chat, it will again get stuck on the loading screen. Anything outside of regular banking, it will be stuck on the loading screen. I have a Galaxy S21 Ultra and these features (except live chat) has never worked for me. Was at one point locked out of my account because I used windows subsystem for android to sign into the app, because my phone broke and the website wouldn't let me sign in, had some perks removed or reduced because of this. Irritating but whatever. Biggest complaint tho is I randomly get ""your biometrics aren't working right now"" when trying to sign in with my fingerprint, despite every other app never giving me this issue, and this app it'll work sometimes and then it won't, no rhyme or reason",genuine
com.csam.icici.bank.imobile,"Pretty good app. I mostly use it for funds transfer and viewing bank account info. Ability to transfer funds to non-ICICI payees is missing in app. Not sure why it made sense to not include it. Quick fund transfer feature is also missing afaict (or at least I can't locate it easily). iPal seems to be a joke. Looks like some product manager got a hefty bonus claiming that they integrated a chatbot into the app and left it to die after that. It can't even understand and help with simple queries. Love this app because of the seamless experience and everything on your finger tip. But Card section needs improvement. UI of ‚ÄúManage Card‚Äù looks cool but UX is very poor. Upper half screen is wasted displaying card number name and validity, leaving less than half of screen for the more important things. If you scroll you can see only 2 recent transaction at a time. Making he whole screen scrollable will really help. And adding Auto Pay feature will be awesome. Go to current statement and the last transaction is hiding behind the buttons. And why last statement section is showing current outstanding and not last billed amount. No info if you have made the payment of last bill, often I make payment twice. Please indicate if I have made the payment or not. And It just shows how much reward point I have but no way to redeem is frustrating. Recently I have started running into the following error while paying my bills. ""Please place this request before the current date. #990020"". This is a very cryptic error, which doesn't explain what the real issue is. I was able to pay my bills fine until last month! This is one of the worst banking apps I have ever used! Terrible!!! I use this app mostly for UPI transactions. What I don't understand is why do I need to close the pop-up about upi being enabled for NRI customers using intentional numbers? It's extremely frustrating to close this pop up every time. Also the functionality doesn't work fully. I can't receive money via upi because of my international number.

Can't set up recurring payments, and scheduled payments are difficult to create and verify, requiring navigating too many separate screens and sub menus.

Have trouble logging in, gives the something has gone wrong. I have to restart phone and then can log in. Also cache won't clear. Why? Old review: 5/3 app is great! I tried using my tablet for deposits and it could not take a picture. Downloaded app to my phone and it worked great! Just takes a few minutes to find your way around the app. and then good to go! Don't care for the layout. Can't see balance after each transaction. The floating help button can't be gotten rid of and blocks the view. After depositing a check I clicked on the account to see what other transactions were there and it just keep asking me for a nickname for the account. Check deposit is nice though. But I prefer to use the desktop for getting all the info. App crashes every time I attempt to utilize the Zelle function. Cleared the cache, as recommended after the third consecutive crash and same result. Select move money with Zelle, and once you press 'Pay' the app immediately goes back to the login screen. Other functions seem to work ok, but the UI isn't overly friendly. Maybe once I get used to it more it will feel natural, but really have to hunt through the menus to find functions.",genuine

However a new gripe arose..it could be a bug or something but now it no longer displays previous balance or displays how much you spent on similar places and things. I was trying to keep track of spending habits to try to cut back but now that's going to be far more difficult. It's a easy to use and simple app with multiple features - virtual cards, daily balance notifications, option to lock cards, FEE FREE overdraft if you use direct deposit, transfer monet, pay al bill and even a map with a choice of ATMs that you can withdraw from for free and side hustle opportunities. BUT I don't like the new layout. the option to lock your card used to be along the bottom but it's now located in settings. I don't like clicking on too many things to use one feature. Not an accurate reflection of account activity. Personal experiences: Account will be refunded, and the next day, it dissappears, or I'm waiting on a refund & 2 wks later the app still doesn't show it nor my funds but a team member confirms I received it after only 3 days. I've had disputes not show, transactions missing for entire months, and more. Not only do I not recommend the Chime app, but I don't recommend this online banking platform. If ever there is an issue...!!! Let the app breathe between changes! Every time I open it, the app has a MAJOR change, and rarely for the better. Now, to unlock my cards, I don't have a simple tap>toggle. Oh no, I have to load my virtual cards, then look at my virtual cards, then I have to switch to physical, after another couple clicks I can finally turn them off or on. This is not good app design.

com.pnc.ecommerce.mobile,"Conflicted on this app. It crashes nearly every time I use it or tells me the service is unavailable and then works immediately upon reload. The biometric sign in breaks nearly every time you have to manually log in. Which is often because the app crashes so much. My local credit union, which is a small company, has an app that is more functional than this thing. I do like that it has mobile deposit though and it works so it's a middle of the road experience. It feels like every single time i need this app the most, it crashes (which is rare) or forces me to manually log in instead of using biometrics which is just as secure if not more secure than the password that someone could snag while shoulder surfing if i so happen to check that i didn't put it in wrong. Very annoying and inconvenient. Other than that, ill say the app is very good. *update* yet another update. Now I cannot access my checking account at all. This app is garbage.

The last update has slowed the app to a crawl, but it does have a banner to ""welcome new customers"" I hope they are ready for the disappoinment. If you rely on an app to do your banking, find a different bank. It constantly forgets my fingerprints, and there's no way I can remember the conplicated password.

com.dave,"It's ok to have for emergencies but not that great overall. The surveys are a joke. If you click on the 2 or more dollar ones, you will never get the full dollar amount. There is always a reason after you've spent a good amount of time that they aren't going to give you the money. Also they charge a monthly membership which isn't that bad but also ask for a tip on top of it. The plus is it's easy and convenient when your in a bind. ""client support""'is üíØ % AI, and so limited, even my AI is better. I guess they opted for basic program, because it's only capable of 4 questions. Initially, I got a microloan (+fees/tips) repaid before due, which raised my limit. Then repeated with a bigger amount. But the 3rd loan went to ""Dave Checking"", and I couldnt settle early, or resolve the issue since support is non-existent. I can't afford mistakes, or a delay with finances, so I'm out. Was a good service until they changed their policies. Now you pay the membership fee and $10 to withdraw. They split your advance into 2, and each withdrawal fee is $5 each. So, if your advance was say $200 you can get $100 first, plus pay the $5 fee. Then you can get the other $100 and pay another $5 fee. This doesn't improve the customer's experience. It just fills the pockets of the app's investors with more money without any benefit to the user. Pure greed.

com.fundsindia,"Great platform for investors... Keep up good work and continue the client centric approach... A decent and very simple app. Good for beginners not so much for experienced traders. The new options are good. The customer service is also very responsive and good. Advanced tools like value averaging investment plans are unique and great to the platform. But apart from these it is pretty basic Had horrible experience with funds india. Had SIP through this portal since 2017. I kept investing money & now in 2024 when i reviewed my folio, it is like hell. In last 7 & half yr i didnt even get return of 6%. If I could have kept this amount FD RD , that could have given me more returns. Lot many promises given by fundsindia in 2017 but no one contacted me for last 7yr and i lost a good return on my hard earn money. This is cheap and third class and pls never use this app for investment Unlike other broker apps, the user cannot cancel SIPs on his/her own. Everytime u need to cancel an SIP, it requires the user to contact the service providers by email, phone or in-website chat service to put forward the request. But it doesn't end there, the executives will try their best to persuade u, and in the process frustrate and waste time . Personally, each SIP cancellation required me to ask them a total of 3 times (all this while ignoring the advisor's pleas)tofinally grant my request",genuine

If you change the SIP amount either increase or decrease, Kuvera first cancels the existing SIP amt and then create a new SIP, due to this one of my SIP got canceled since the fund was not accepting new inflows. Suggest Kuvera to just edit the sip amount or first create a new SIP amount and only if successful should cancel the existing SIP. I have been using Kuvera for a long time and liked it but since a few months there have been issues and there is no proper response even when the ticket is raised and despite multiple follow ups.

Feedback on App Interface. I have noticed that the app's interface has undergone frequent changes, which unfortunately detract from the overall user experience. The current layout lacks clarity, making it difficult to access comprehensive information from the homepage. While introducing new features is essential, it's equally important to maintain a simple and intuitive interface that provides users with all the necessary information at a glance.",genuine
com.csam.icici.bank.imobile,"This app used to be good 2-3 years back when Apps were new to that time. It needs a complete overhaul and needs to be rewritten to give a good user experience. In its current form, it appears that it was written by some novices.  It hasn't been able to keep up with changing times and feels archaic. Look at HDFC Bank app and get some inspiration.  Giving 2 stars for the functionality it offers, if you provide a better customer Experience will rate better. it's an excellent app. I'm able to do most of my transactions using this app. from the point of view of functionality, user-friendliness and interface it is an excellent applicarion. I use other banks' mobile app as well and none offers such vast variety of features. Though there are some logical issues that's why I'm not giving 5 stars. 1 major issue is that I can't use iMobile for my multiple accounts. For example, personal account and joint account or a minor account. Such extreme latency and inability to load the app at start. Waste of time just to get the app started. With every upgrade it's getting more horrible. Edit: It has become even more useless, not even able to log into the app since last 30 mins. No improvement at all and it seems there is no point in expecting it to improve as well. I have been using this app for several years and was quite satisfied with it. Recently whenever I logged in I got a notification to update the app. When I clicked to update the Google Play showed only Uninstall or Open buttons. There was no option to update. Today i uninstalled the App and when I try to Install I get a message that this phone is not compatible with this app. I have Samsung Galaxy Note 8.

com.remitly.androidapp,"App is very easy to use, delivery is fast, reliable and secure. It's also amazing how they try to reply to each and every review posted here! One thing though, I found about 3-4 competitors that offer way much higher exchange rates (usd to php) as much as $1.30 higher! This tempted me to try other services, even if delivery is not as fast. If Remitly will be competitive in this area, surely they will be the best. I really enjoyed using Remitly due to its easy and user-friendly interface. It has proven to be a reliable platform. However, I have noticed that the widget feature, which was extremely helpful for quickly checking the destination price, has been removed in the recent update. I genuinely miss this feature and wonder if there is any possibility of bringing it back. Absolutely terrible app and service. I tried it since it seemed convenient, only to have a transfer to my mother for her birthday get canceled by the app. Then I was told to wait 24hrs before trying the app again, which I did, only for it to happen again. Then I was told I have to wait again, but now for 24hrs-48hrs instead to be contacted to have it fixed. Using a wingless carrier pigeon would be faster, more user friendly, and more technologically advanced than using this app. DO NOT USE!!! I was using Remitly for several months now and it was great. It was. Recently it wanted me to provide my information to verify, I did, got suspened for no reason after exchanging with the customer service. Worst experience. Heard some users had the same issue too. So what's the point of verifying, giving them personal info/ID only to get suspended?

Couldn't access account due to this and a lot of time wasted but yet they still wanted me to pay my monthly payments. But because they couldn't fix my account I wasn't able to use my account which was very unfortunate. I generally don't use these kinds of apps, but my furnace switch went out preventing the heat from clicking on. After a week of no heat, I figured let me give it a try. Unware of the hoops. Sign up process is extremely horrible. It 45 mins to get the app to accept my sign up info - as it kept send back to the begin to start over.

com.activehours,"Don't know what happened, used this all the time. Then, two weeks ago, it kept telling me my bank credentials were wrong. Once it stopped doing that, it suddenly stopped working again. Contacted support, and the app was saying it was connected to my savings even though it showed my checking account was linked. Cashed out. And suddenly it's doing it again. It also just gives me a blank screen when I attempt to ""select the account"". I think this will be the end of me using this. I like the app initially and though it does help having extra funds, the app disconnects my bank account OFTEN. When it does disconnect, 9/10 times it is for no reason, and also delays me from attaining not only my money that I can cash out that I REALLY need, but it also takes days at times to reconnect and at times prevents me from receiving my paycheck early too which was the whole reason I needed the app in the first place. Not a terrible app, just very buggy sometimes. So I've had this app for about a year or more now. I never had any issues using it. I would borrow and payback on time. My borrow amount even went up after a while. Even if my bank account was in the negative already or the amount that I borrowed came out and put me in the negative, the transaction would still go through. Now I'm seeing that they're ""bouncing"" and being returned. I called my bank and told them the problem, and even they see the transaction going through completely on their end. I tried it like I tried other tech companies, and it doesn't work with Chime or Varo as most people have or use these institutions. My issue was going through the process only to be given a notice of not being able not to use either. Which wasted my time by signing up with this company. When searching online, it says chime works, but as I can see, it does not. One star is well deserved as I pointed it, can't give anything higher because I was not able to finish testing driving the app.",genuine

The only issue is that even after many updates, the app lags sooooo much that it makes it difficult to use.

If you don't mind the extra $35 a month (includes $14.99 monthly and $8.99 instant fee per advance), it's worth the access to the services provided.

It works and I've gotten plenty of advanced but it's extremely annoying that it constantly lags and that app not responding message pops up repeatedly. I can't think of why it would.

Other than that, easily a five star app. I enjoy the app but it would be nice if, as your score goes up, the amount you have to tip would go down but I know that's at the discretion of the lender. Overall, it's a decent app. Has a couple glitches where it sends you on a loop and you have to contact customers service to fix it but other than that, I appreciate this app a lot. It's gotten me through some rough times. Grateful I found it! The App and its lenders are a God send. and definitely helps when needed.

com.klovercredit.android_app,"I am someone who is skeptical and doesn't always trust these apps. But I have to say so far I am very pleased. The fee is low, and the optional tip is nice to not having to be forced, and if you do leave a tip, you can choose how much. In got my advance super fast as well. Update I have been using this for months and it's literally a lifesaver. I also have found so many games I love I actually really enjoyed using this app! It has a unique approach that not only . assists you with a modest advance, but allows you to earn the amount with points giving you a chance to control a little how much, but also allows you to choose ways you enjoy. making the points. I'm glad I heard about it in an ad on Youtube. . . . it's a lot for not so much pay out. I enjoy it but if I needed the money for food, I would starve. Feedback... In two months I've had one advance. In that time you've taken twice as much from me. it seems like in the long run, the only help is you helping yourself. The time it takes to accumulate any significant amount of coins would be fine if I could sit around on the phone all day. You would think with effort required, it would not require repayment. App itself works fine. Advances are a joke. If you have accumulated any decent amount of points,then they will drop your base advance to $50 or lower and force you to use points if you need a little more. I opened the app one day, and it said my max base was $100. About an hour later, 3000 points hit from completing an offer, and suddenly my base dropped to $25, and I would have had to use 3000 points to get more. Don't get me started on their fees!!! $18 in fees for a $150 advance. No thanks!!",genuine
com.b9.app,"This app has a few...intricacies...that are tough to swallow at first, such as added fees when sending money to cash app, and the tip option presenting itself twice, which comes off as a little tricky. But after using it for several months, it has grown on me. The app is quick to update your available balance and deposits, the customer service is very easy to work with, and there are no petty penalties or restrictions if you are a day or two late paying back the cash advance. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because of having to receive a code via text every time you sign into the app. That gets a little aggravating when you need to look at your balance really quick. Other than that, the ability to get an advance when needed has been a life saver and the ease of navigating the app has been really easy. I wrote a review a while back saying so far I liked the service. However, now I have to eat my own words. The advance part is great but they charge you an external wallet fee anytime you transfer money to any service but theirs. That begins to add up. I did two transfers and it cost $20 dollars. In these hard times that is alot. Would not recommend this card to anyone who has loved ones they need to send money to. I want this to be a good card but it lacks. Pros: can get paid early, yes you can receive an advance. Cons: They do not show up on plaid or finacity. App is glitchy. There's issues with transactions being decline randomly. Does not work very well with cash app either, they'll both point fingers 8f you have an issue. Any deposit made, even with cashing out from cash app will immediatel go towards paying your advance. Customer service is polite, but does not really resolve any problems.",genuine

com.q2e.firsttradeunionbank3351.mobile.production,"I've only been using LendingClub for a few months. And only for savings because they have a high yield interest for account holders. You can pay bills through the site if you have a checking account. Other than that, the app is pretty straightforward and easy to navigate. I like creditwise. It shows your Trans union credit score and offers advice, and gives you options to make it better. Nothing fancy but that's how I like it. Radius is best bank I've ever had. I've been a member for over 10 years and during that time have saved and earned money with their interest bearing and fee free checking account. The interest they pay out is higher than most big bank savings accounts. The app allows you to effortlessly perform all of your banking needs with an intuitive and easy to app. Needs some refinement. I would like to see pending transactions immediately showing in my activity/account. I don't like having just an email sent. I want to be able to see every transaction, whether one has been initiated, pending, or completed. It is important for people to know the status of their money at all times. I may change my rating once this can be solved. Thanks! I'm new to LendingClub. The camera app for depositing checks is weak/frustrating. I also have a Capital One account that I have used for decades, their app is quick and easy. LendingClub app does not do well on back side of check (more white space?), it battles with the ""too much light"" when nothing (lighting, etc) is different than the front side.

It's EXTREMELY hard & mostly impossible for ME to be able to check my bank account EVERYDAY for automatic payments that come out. As far as the app itself, has lots of features/options- takes some time to navigate/learn. It simplifies things & ALLOWS YOU TO CANCEL RIGHT FROM THE APP!! Ok app. Really nickels and dimes you for everything. Go premium cost $ (and really not useful without it). Want to lower bills like the ads, that's more $ (not really sure if it actually works). In the end, I just went back to my old budgeting software. This would have ended up costing me more money than without it. I installed and subscribed to the app for one subscription I wanted it to cancel for me but it couldn't help me. It told me the steps to take but I already knew the steps (going in person or writing a certified letter).

I really like the backup options, and the interface.

Number two is the ability to set a default account for expenses so that I don't have to add that every time.

com.droid4you.application.wallet,"The app is good in general but there is a serious bug that breaks all the beauty. If you have a planned payment and you change the due date by postponing it then the planned payment due date is updated but the scheduled payment record is never removed. As a result, when the original planned payment date arrives the scheduled record is converted to an actual record, subtracting from your balance. So, even if you wanted to pay later, the app decides that you paid earlier as well. Originally would have given a higher rating, my partner and I have used this for going on 6 years or so now and it's been extremely helpful with keeping track of financial spending and saving. However, with the most recent update a feature was removed that we used on a regular to balance everything and find missing charges. The Balance Adjustment feature is gone, I know you just pull out a calculator and split the difference but you pay for the features you like and that was one of many. Edit (new): I used to love this app, purchased a lifetime subscription. Went back today to start tracking money and expenses for new year and found out I can't link my bank account anymore, hence no sync. So now I should put in every transaction manually or through monthly import, which is a lot of work, for 4 credit cards AND bank account? That's a huge ""NOPE"" for me. Sorry, but that makes it not worth using. In the latest version, you can't change currency from the transaction screen anymore. I travel a lot and that was super convenient. Terrible update.

It's simple but detailed. I like the option of explaining what I'm inputting. The different categories help alot and the option to include new categories. I also like the option to change the currency from USD. Edit Feb 2025 I still love the app. I was wondering if you could look into integrating with mobile banking apps? For direct transaction recording. Wish there was a way to create a temporary list due for pending transactions that have not posted to get a clearer understanding of the true balance of my accounts. Adding an interest accrued option so it updates w/new balances after each statement. Since it tabulates the total loan amount, changing it is a pain. Paying lines of credit/credit cards with transfer isnt a good option. Needs an auto sync option Convoluted, as all of these ""budget"" apps seem to be. I'm really not sure what they are teaching accountants that makes it so difficult for them to understand simple things like money. They seem to need to overly complicate basic arithmetic. Anyway, this little app doesn't seem to understand much on its own, like how credit cards work, and I gave up trying to shoehorn things around to try to match up to my actual balances.

Had an email conversation with support about Login issue and mentioned that there was an activity over the weekend due to which the app/web portal wasnt accepting logins and asked to clear the cache and re-try it. Cache clearing was not needed after the maintenance window. I am able to get in now into the app without any issues. Hence updating my review. Thanks a lot Interface is now very cool and fast, just one thing missing, when I click on chart(not maximised chart) it hasn't day, week, month, year, year etc returns on chart like groww.

com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.finance,"I really like the app and everything it does, but man is it slow and choppy. I haven't used an app in a few years that's as slow as this. It freezes often, it takes a while to load (not Internet, the app itself), even reading articles is choppy. As I scroll the app suddenly hangs and then snaps into position. I move the screen as I read, not my eyes, so this makes it almost too frustrating to ready an article. I have a high end phone with 16gb ram too. I don't understand why it's so laggy. This Yahoo Finance app does not always work correctly. The chart area shows up blank or has serious problems keeping your charting indicators.like the moving average, but everything else seems to work well. I would only use the free version, because paying you may get disappointed because when you really need to use the charring won't work. But all other areas work well and makes it a good app. Giving it 3 stars because when it goes down, it stays down for days on end. The app is okay most of the time. Sometimes it won't load. The web page is trash though. Around December they updated it to some table format that doesn't fit in the screen so you have to scroll everywhere wasting 4+ inches of both sides of the screen. Also, it's a constant barrage of ""error 500"" no matter what browser you try. Don't worry though this will get the bottom response and that will fix everything. The functionality of recording transactions periodically freezes up, preventing any ability to save new transactions. This will be true across all devices, regardless of browser or clearing browser cache. You will be asked to do this ever time you report it to Yahoo. They ask the same questions every time, they'll close your case when they want to. They have switched to an ""enhanced"" portfolio that hardly adds any value. If you knew the previous portfolio viewer prepare to be disappointed.",genuine

com.joinroot.root,"They claim to adjust your payments based on good driving habits and such but I haven't seen single discount since I started over a year ago while maintaining a perfect ten on both scales they use. While it probably isn't false advertising, it seems shady that they pretend it's a huge feature when it clearly isn't. The price has been increased every time by 20 or more each payment. I started at 159 and am now at 241. Ridiculous. Customer service told me I was SOL and I can leave if I want. The company's ideals are awesome. Insure safe drivers and don't insure otherwise. I had a fantastic rate at first and they were always helpful and eager to settle my claims. However, after the one year mark, my rate doubled for seemingly no reason. I haven't been given an explanation. Also, the app keeps track of whether you're driving safe, even if you're the passenger in another vehicle. That doesn't seem entirely fair. I carpool a lot and I've watched my phone usage get worse because of it. Finished the 30 day trail and my insurance went up by $50 instead of going down. Your score doesn't really matter, still have to pay more and doesn't go down. Took longer to get score than I thought I would. My score was 8/10. I drove the best I ever had during the time. Didn't explain my score. Price didn't stay the same just increased. No option to not download thier app. The app still tracks you after the trail. I did really well on my driving test, got a 10/10 with perfect braking, and yet after my test drive was over, they bumped up my rate from $131 to $139 per month. I have no tickets or anything, but they still bumped up my rates, and I don't understand the point of the test drive if a perfect score also leads to a bump up in price.

I did cancel the second one immediately, but it was shown as a pending withdrawal from my account. I am hoping that on only one withdrawal will be made. Hopefully, when needed, filing claims will not be as confusing or stressful. The renters insurance is affordable and the app is fine. But the car insurance tracks your driving, and it runs in the background all day (not just when you're driving). As a result, it drains my Pixel 6a battery about twice as fast. In addition, there is no way to check your driving ""score"" or get any sort of information on the data they are collecting on your driving. Zero. So if you pay for 6 months of insurance, you have to just wait and see if they decide to raise the price. This app has been a pain from the start. Did you know you can't change your email without help? If the app fails and you have to use a regular computer and a browser you cannot print any documents. Speaking of printing, there are no real printing options like other insurance companies have.

Unless I turn my location off, rendering the phone useless, my score is affected, especially distance travelled and phone usage. I would love it if the app gave me an option to say whether I was the driver or not. There are a lot of settings and changes to be done before the App can work, which is frustrating. I lost a few days trying to figure it out.

Much better than geicos $300 quote and progressives $210 with basic insurance (I had been with them for many many years). Edit to add: Not a 'terrible' app icon per say. But another color for the C would be more pleasing to the eye! Just one opinion. :) I find it super annoying that you can't do partial payments or even double payments. If it's not the current due amount or full balance you have no other options. I also find it stupid annoying that I had to wait until my renewal date to submit a payment because it kept telling me I had a zero balance which caused me to pay late. This app/company can use some major upgrades for things thats literally offered EVERYWHERE! I switched from Progressive after feeling like my premiums were too high for a single male at 48-years old having a stellar driving record with no tickets, incidents or accidents for years. Although Clearcover was slightly cheaper, the lack of customer care is seriously lacking. Clearcover offers no way to contact them without doing a Google search for a customer service number. You get what you pay for. Clearcover lives up to that.",genuine

Which is a breath of fresh air considering hardships that can happen so quickly. I absolutely recommend. In the long run ...it's worth it. Overall it is a great app. There are a few things I wish were improved such as working with Plaid for connectivity with other apps. The increases on advances aren't very clear. I have been stuck at $130 even tho I pay back on time everytime, I deposit a lot of money and am a premium subscriber. Also, the international fees really add up. Other than that, I like the banking experience. I just had my first deposit of my pay check. Only issue so far I notice are the fees. I think they have one of the highest fees and possibly out of other apps Ive dealt with. Other than that, I think they have good things to offer as far as cashback rewards. I am not sure if they'll make up for the monthly subscription, but I still am new with them. This is the best app for getting advances as well as the easiest plus you unlock a higher limit with your next direct deposit. The reason for giving only 3 stars is because of the monthly plan that's required along with its ridiculous price.

com.useline.line,"Using Beam Cash Advance App has significantly improved my financial management. As someone who often struggled with budgeting and timely bill payments, the app's feature for giving a cash advance has been a lifesaver. It has saved me from high-interest debts and late payment charges. The app has an extremely user-friendly interface, making it easy to monitor my income, expenses, and savings. More impressively, its cash advance feature comes with no interest, lending fees, or hidden charges As of my experience, it was easy to set up. I chose all my income transactions vs expenses and I qualified for $60. The weird thing is it only let me do $30 and you have to pay the $2 subscription fee up front. It says the 30 dollars will arrive shortly so for now I will rate 4 stars. I will update after using for a little time so I can accurately review. This app is totally useless. I got an email invite to get health insurance for 30 days. Which was really nice, looks, and sounds great. But then I downloaded the app I realized that I have to log in everything all the time because there's no account that is saved to the app at all.

My check doesn't hit my account until 8 am. Dave starts trying to settle at the stroke of midnight. There's no way to change the time or schedule a time for the settlement to occur. Hopefully they fix that, too. Then I can feel secure in using all of its features more often. Don't tip. It doesn't go to hungry ppl The cash advances are good but not surveys. I've been doing the surveys but as soon as I get to the end it kicks me out and doesn't give me any of the rewards or half. I've cc messaged multiple times but nothing done. I don't even get partial amount. And it says no late fees but it won't give you another advance for almost 3 weeks. Like that's the penalty. It's ok to have for emergencies but not that great overall. The surveys are a joke. If you click on the 2 or more dollar ones, you will never get the full dollar amount. There is always a reason after you've spent a good amount of time that they aren't going to give you the money. Also they charge a monthly membership which isn't that bad but also ask for a tip on top of it. The plus is it's easy and convenient when your in a bind. ""client support""'is üíØ % AI, and so limited, even my AI is better. I guess they opted for basic program, because it's only capable of 4 questions.

There is a downside but ill get to it in a min. So rhis app offers the ability to collect points doing other things like playing games, surveys, and some others. you can use points to increase ur advance and use them to pay some of the fees. thats awesome! however, it comes at a tiny price. you have your standard fee on the advance but if u use points and increase it you have a fee on the extra amount. instead of it being 1 advance 1 fee its 2. the higher the advance the higher the fee this is an okay way to get cash advance. didnt like that first I was approved for $50 and then 15 min later the amount decreased to $25. the next day I checked and again I was approved $50 but a couple minutes later it changed to $25. also. the spin the wheel game was confusing and I lost 400 points playing it. all of my sign up bonus points were gone! Beware of the games listed to get more points. Easy to use but the advance amount is very small so not worth the fees.

This is basically a gambling app. As a lender, don't put in more than you can afford to lose. The app itself is fairly simple and easy to use. The promissory notes have a 36 day payback, but the displayed payback terms are much shorter. You will be badgered in to getting lending protection and then when a loan is inevitably late you'll be badgered in to taking a credit for half the value (no tip) of the loan.

com.creditgenie.app,"I've used this app off and on for a few months, it always helps when I'm in a pinch. I definitely recommend it as one of the best. they loan you the money, they don't sell your info to third party lenders. Only downside is recently I tried to pay back my advance and it said they disconnected my bank because they no longer provide services in my state. was and still a great experience using , straight forward , bit on the pricier side but over all a great experience. went to use my advance today and all I get is an error message saying there was a problem saving my advance information... worst timing ever . as i could have really used that extra cash 0_o Horrible customer service! Don't waist your time with this app especially with other apps out there that don't charge you these crazy fees. $12 to transfer $100, 8.99 a month. Takes a week for advance to settle before you can get a new advance even though it's cleared my bank on the day it's due. Tried numerous times to link my debit card without success and customer service email me saying I'm inputting my info incorrectly! I know which card is linked to my bank. Not even an option to cancel I contacted these people a long time ago and asked them to close out my account and cancel any subscriptions and I get the message that my account is disabled and can't login but for some unknown reason instead of closing out my account and canceling any subscriptions all they did was stop me from being logged in and kept my account open and are still trying to charge my checking account for a subscription!

You can borrow a decent amount of money if needed, and you can build up the amount you want to receive. Best thing is being able to switch money from checking to savings and vice versa at anytime, instantly. Been using Varo for about 4 years now, and any problems I've had they fixed quickly. Definitely download this if your still using NetSpend cards. Thank me later! Love this banking App. Helped me a lot while paying huge interest rates on loans. It took away the edge bills went up so much. I didn't have to graw my teeth so much. I could pay back with no interest. Also there are credit rating, giving you your score. This helps as well. Yes I would recommend this App, you can transfer between check and savings and checking and credit. Yeah. You can lock you card if it is lossed or stolen. Transfer funds from your brick and mortar bank to Varo. Try it out I'm not adding any more money until you fix the change email feature. You send a verification message which is supposed to have a link but doesn't, to the old email address. I'll probably transfer out all of my money to a competent ""bank""...Chime may have a smaller interest rate, but at least they have a search feature now and changing profile info is easy BUT it is SECURE. Yes, you have the steps to change, but in the app it still doesn't alter the fact that it is impossible to change. Very glitchy since the new update and look. It doesn't scroll smoothly anymore and is very jerky. When I scroll, I can only see a week of the current month then it jumps back to the end of the previous month. I can no longer see the first 3 weeks of the months. When I try to go to a desktop site on my phone it takes me right back to the app. Very frustrating!!!!",genuine

Will update if it changes It's not a bad app really I just hate the fact that one moment it's offers me a $50 advance and the few hours it's offering $25. It's kind of weird and aggravating because I was depending on $50 because that's what I was granted last pay period. I like the fact that I can go up the street to Walgreens atm to withdraw money for FREE! I see their adding more features which is nice and a plus BUT ... my only problem is how often the advance offers fluctuate. This has been the most inconsistent frustrating app i have ever used. Its constantly freezing up or glitching. Payments start pending and take 4 or 5 days before the even clear. Even then it will start saying a new advance is pending days before its even due! Getting money from them is nearly impossible due to the problems the app has. Wish it worked right because when it does its a nice easy process. Dave or earnin are much better alternatives due to these issue. Try them instead. New User Not sure what is going on, I tried moving funds to another account and it keeps saying error, with nothing else? I've left a message in the support chat and I still haven't heard anything. The FAQ section, doesn't have anything there to help me. I hate when businesses operate from message only, without having anyone to call.

I never used this app before so I tried connecting my bank and it says limit reached try again in a month. What does that even mean. Honestly, I've had to use other apps that were better than that. They want you to buy stuff , especially stuff that you probably would never be using, just to qualify for points for a cash advance. If they had stores on the app like walmart target home depot , I could definitely go for that, but this app is very frustrating. And honestly, I don't trust it.Perhaps I'll try to get in the future, but for right now, i'm staying clear. Terrible. They have a store called Cornerstone where they push you to spend money.

One thing though is it automatically takes whatever money you have on due date and after if not paid in full. Also one Last thing is the instant fee is like 4.99 for 150 for me. Not bad at all. I recommend I have been using this app for about a year before deciding to rate it, and it definitely deserves a great rating. Using the app you have your own savings account accessible from your phone. You can set up multiple folders and decide which you want your money to go into and how much you want. You can set up an automatic transfer where Albert will pull a small portion of funds from your checking account and put it into your Albert account. Those are just 2 perks to this app, check it out. Albert is now REQUIRING a subscription to Genius plus in order to even access the app. It was convenient source for an emergency extra $50 or so a paycheck but this feels like extortion.

The app manages to take my money, but doesn't utilize it like it's supposed to. Like the app just needs a whole reset for me or something. I just downgraded my membership and will let that expire.

My check doesn't hit my account until 8 am. Dave starts trying to settle at the stroke of midnight. There's no way to change the time or schedule a time for the settlement to occur. Hopefully they fix that, too. Then I can feel secure in using all of its features more often. Don't tip. It doesn't go to hungry ppl The cash advances are good but not surveys. I've been doing the surveys but as soon as I get to the end it kicks me out and doesn't give me any of the rewards or half. I've cc messaged multiple times but nothing done. I don't even get partial amount. And it says no late fees but it won't give you another advance for almost 3 weeks. Like that's the penalty. Was a good service until they changed their policies. Now you pay the membership fee and $10 to withdraw. They split your advance into 2, and each withdrawal fee is $5 each. So, if your advance was say $200 you can get $100 first, plus pay the $5 fee. Then you can get the other $100 and pay another $5 fee. This doesn't improve the customer's experience. It just fills the pockets of the app's investors with more money without any benefit to the user. Pure greed. The app was working just fine for me for the longest time, but now after the update with split advances, all of sudden when I try to cash out at all it just says ""dave hit an issue loading your advances summary"" I've deleted and updated the app, restarted my phone, and nothing works.

io.floatme.floatmeapp,"Love the app! It is exactly what it is described to be, however, there are a few flaws that I feel can be changed or made better. 1. the games don't always record your progess or don't show that you've installed a game and playing it. Then when you notice the issue, you won't respond. This is a problem. 2. The payment methods are ridiculous. If I want to cash out some money why does it take such a large fee. If I need $80, I shouldn't get only $60. Again ridiculous. 3. Communication is KEY,ty Nothing major, but once you establish an account with the app, it's always provided me with a quick $20 that I can borrow and pay back at a later date. Among the cash apps, that's probably too low for some people who may not wish to bother when it's such a small amount being advanced. However, it takes into account your credit rating & payback history too as to what you are able to borrow. Requesting the advance is quick & painless. The funding after the request is instantaneous. In the reply? Tried to use the app, i don't care about any of the features just the advance. I already know how to budget i was just in a unexpected jam. Their app would not function correctly when trying to check my income, it failed to let me manually enter it where it would get stuck in processing. I tried to cancel, it glitched during that then i find out later I'm still being charged service fee. I went to try 3 more times to confirm it cancels correctly before it finally seems went through. No refund I signed up and was charged the membership fee. I tried to make my first withdrawal of $20, which is the max you are allowed starting out. I kept getting denied, and customer support said it's because of data points and stuff that the system determines your eligibility. Still can not withdraw any amount, but they didn't have any issue withdrawaling my membership fee so I'm paying for a service I can't use.",genuine
com.activehours,"Don't know what happened, used this all the time. Then, two weeks ago, it kept telling me my bank credentials were wrong. Once it stopped doing that, it suddenly stopped working again. Contacted support, and the app was saying it was connected to my savings even though it showed my checking account was linked. Cashed out. And suddenly it's doing it again. It also just gives me a blank screen when I attempt to ""select the account"". I think this will be the end of me using this. I like the app initially and though it does help having extra funds, the app disconnects my bank account OFTEN. When it does disconnect, 9/10 times it is for no reason, and also delays me from attaining not only my money that I can cash out that I REALLY need, but it also takes days at times to reconnect and at times prevents me from receiving my paycheck early too which was the whole reason I needed the app in the first place. Not a terrible app, just very buggy sometimes. Highly recommend! Great and fast customer service. You have the option to pay a fee (tip), which helps other individuals loan out funds. But unfortunately, I have to give them 2 stars due to them stating misleading information about what banks they support. I attempted to connect my bank account and it states ""bummer, we can't connect with the bank"" Very misleading. I would give this app a 4-star rating because I do enjoy it.

The only issue is that even after many updates, the app lags sooooo much that it makes it difficult to use.

The price is a bit steep for same-day advance but as far as fees are concerned it's definitely not the worst I've come across. If you don't mind the extra $35 a month (includes $14.99 monthly and $8.99 instant fee per advance), it's worth the access to the services provided. There are features I do not use that would be available to someone with direct deposit that would justify the fees imo Terrible payment platform.

I've had the money in my account since before the repayment date. I can't even add a new card/bank account because it gets blocked as well. I've always paid my advances before this also so it makes no sense. Was a decent app for a while. Upgraded from plus plan to credit builder for extra money on my ""borrowing"" (advance).

Went to borrow money and won't let me transfer to my original debit card ive been using with them for almost a year, forces me to send to credit builder.

They don't tell you that they will take the money you owe without notice. They engage in malicious ""accumulate points"" tactics, which often times aren't even granted/rewarded.

Overall it is a great app. There are a few things I wish were improved such as working with Plaid for connectivity with other apps. The increases on advances aren't very clear. I have been stuck at $130 even tho I pay back on time everytime, I deposit a lot of money and am a premium subscriber. Also, the international fees really add up. Other than that, I like the banking experience. I wrote a review a while back saying so far I liked the service. However, now I have to eat my own words. The advance part is great but they charge you an external wallet fee anytime you transfer money to any service but theirs. That begins to add up. I did two transfers and it cost $20 dollars. In these hard times that is alot. Would not recommend this card to anyone who has loved ones they need to send money to. I want this to be a good card but it lacks. Pros: can get paid early, yes you can receive an advance. Cons: They do not show up on plaid or finacity. App is glitchy. There's issues with transactions being decline randomly.

com.truefinance,"I'm typically skeptical when asked to pay upfront before I can verify the software actually works but I figure I'd try. Unfortunately, I paid the $4.99 but the link to my bank (Wells Fargo) failed after signing in thru Plaid. It forces you to login to True again and the session you were in no longer exists. I tied multiple times with same result. UPDATE: customer support contacted me and let me know the dev team determined there was error with Plaid and refunded my subscription. it was easy to get signed in and approved, but does not have a option for debit card and instant funding. I needed the money at that moment not 3 plus days later Asking for me to connect my bank account, it verifies the info and goes back to the app. Go to see what I qualify for as far as the advance, it keeps asking for my account to be connected. When it's already connected. Of course they've taken the 4.99 subscription fee from me and I can't even get an advance The that they charge you a subscription, before you even know your bank connects or not. shoot, they charge you before you even know you're approved. greedy update: changed my rating from a 3 stars to a 2 stars. everything you mentioned had nothing to do with the predatory tactics used for people to get approved for loans, that I mentioned. if they have to pay for your subscription first, before knowing their bank connects, before knowing they are approved & how much, that's called greedy",genuine

If you don't believe me, EU just started a sell your data program. This app follows your card purchases and currently pays 2 cents per transaction. They also pay for surveys and games. Now that doesn't seem like a lot but when you add it ontop of the coinbase cash back debit card and a few other things, those purchases add up. I downloaded the app on a whim when in need of a quick few bucks before payday.. super quick and easy process, money was in my account within a few minutes. The app is well designed and I like all the additional features of offers to earn extra cash, track and save your spending and credit builder help. Will definitely utilize some of those features! Been trying to receive a cash advance FOR MONTHS! Went through their email support who claimed they fixed the error and that I could now apply, that was FALSE. My bank is linked, I have more than enough income to show, but everytime I try to link the debit card that is connected to my checking account, it says ""your request is invalid"". Simply the most frustrating advance app out there. I've been using it for over 3 years. Good offers offers. However, the daily amount used to be 8 cents at a point of time. Now it's 3 cents, and recently, my investment account was closed. Reached out to support and never got an answer.

They're great to get money when you need it but the app has its glitches at times which can be frustrating, i.e.- your debit card won't work or their system is down so you can't get an advance but if you email their support team they respond pretty quickly and fix the issue right away. Try them, you'll like them! Beem was easy to set up, but I couldn‚Äôt get the $60 advance I paid for due to issues verifying my Discover card. I was stuck in a ""reconnect"" loop, yet Beem had no problem charging my subscription. Customer service tried to help, but the problem remained unresolved. Eventually, I switched to my SoFi account, which worked fine. Giving 3 stars because the app works for some banks, and customer service put in effort, but Beem needs better compatibility to deliver on what‚Äôs advertised. This app is totally useless. I got an email invite to get health insurance for 30 days. Which was really nice, looks, and sounds great. But then I downloaded the app I realized that I have to log in everything all the time because there's no account that is saved to the app at all. So anytime you go back into the app, you are forced the relogin constantly just to go into it or do anything. It's very unlikely that I will use this beyond the trial period unless improved. It's been ""verifying"" for a week now. I've entered my bank info , was verified every time only to be asked to connect My bank again. Then, it didn't even give me an option to enter the information, it just said it couldn't connect to my bank, I exited out, signed back in and it says ""it's taking longer than normal to verify your information, we'll notify you when we're done"" I'm confused, to say the least Reached out to their service department only to be told to wait.

Stfrange what a small loan. I get microloans like YesMan and pay them on time to pmp that credit banger cause my credit needs some donk hog in it I got an advance no problem it was only $20. But they only took out a partial payment when it needed to be repaid. It took 6 days to clear the first payment. Lol so they take out the rest of the payment even though the money was already in there, and it's still in limbo waiting to be cleared and that was 3 days ago! I don't really understand that. So if you're trying to borrow money often and think you can borrow after you pay it, this is not the app for you! The fees for getting an advance are outrageous. I use a few cash advance apps and the fee ranges from $3-$6 if you want the money immediately and free if you wait 1-2 days for it. Not this app. If you want the free option you have to wait 3-5 business days which is longer than any other and to have it delivered same day it cost $10.49, for immediate delivery to a debit card it cost $12. and they ask for a tip too.

The borrowing and payback process was easy, and both were credited almost instantly. I am grateful for those who provide the loans, and I include the max tip to show appreciation. I wish that we could send a thank you text, but I guess paying on time and the tip would be thanks enough, lol. Love this app! Super easy to use. Funds come in seconds. I really like the concept if you pay your loans back on time your score goes up and you get offers much faster. It gives you incentives to do the right thing and pay your loans back on time. Still if you start out and your scores not the greatest you'll still get plenty of offers. I've never had any glitches or problems with the app, its always worked smoothly. Hands down one of the best apps out there! 9-24-24: This used to be a good platform to use, even after the banking issues it was ok. But now it's a few months past their transition, and once again I can't cash out all of my funds. Their reason? ""Oh we are doing upgrades again."" So I can't even get the money that was approved, but I'm going to be expected to pay everything back plus the tip to the lender, plus the tip to Solo which it seems they can't even use properly to make their system work or hire more programmers. NOT RECOMMENDED! A fix that definitely needs to be addressed (at least for me) is that when I repay a loan, moments after repayment, my debit card needs to be ""verified."" This is extremely annoying as I have to take time out to go on their chat mode to address the issue. I then have to uninstall, reinstall the app, and enter my banking info all over again.

It was easier and more frequent at the cost of $1.99. Dont like the fact they would show you how much the fee will cost you to transfer money.

com.current.app,"Do not use their Credit Builder card it will decrease your credit score by 30 points at first & then continue to decrease it because it only shows up as a debt, that you owe a balance every month it is reported. Even though it's paid off when they report it, Current does not report the balance is already paid off, just the amount you had spent the prior month. I have credit monitoring that tells me when my score decreases & what caused it. I do like Current outside of their Credit Builder card. Instructions are NOT clear to beginners on how this can affect your credit in negative ways. I had my score drop 34 points because of a balance increase that I thought was safely covered by the credit card that was supposed to limit itself to whatever my balance was, which was more than plenty to cover the costs I used it for. If my spending limit is my balance, what good is it when ANY spending drops my score? Nervous about using it at all until this matter is clarified. False advertising.

The app won't allow you to transfer money back to your bank account. It won't link to another bank account with plaid, just keeps loading forever.

The one thing I would love changed is the showing of all accounts combined as one amount. If I put money into savings, I DO NOT want to see it. When the app is opened and the dashboard is showing, it combines all savings AND checking with one total and it makes me think that total is what I have in my checking. I do deliveries and get paid after each delivery so my account fluctuates so frequently, it's hard to just know what is in my account Works ok, very confusing as to how to get cashback.
